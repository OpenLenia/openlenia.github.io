Five "grand challenges" in the study of Lenia:
1. **Turing completeness** - Is Lenia able to perform universal computation like a computer?
2. **Emergent agency** - Can we train Lenia creatures as emergent agents using machine learning?
3. **Swarm cognition** - Can higher-level cognition emerge in swarms of Lenia creatures?
4. **Automated discovery** - How to discover Lenia creatures through automation or crowd-sourcing?
5. **Open-endedness** - Can we achieve open-ended evolution with Lenia?
